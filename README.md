# Student Marks Analyzer

## Overview
The Student Marks Analyzer is a Python mini project that calculates and displays student performance. It finds the total number of students, average marks, highest and lowest marks, and identifies the top and bottom performing students. This project is suitable for beginners to practice Python basics using dictionaries and lists.

## Use This Data
```python
students = {
    "Zaid": 80,
    "Fatima": 92,
    "Ahmed": 89,
    ...
    ...
    ...
}
````

## Calculations Performed

1. **Separate Marks from Data**

   * Extracted all marks from the dictionary into a list for easier calculations.

2. **Find Total Students and Total Marks**

   * Calculated total number of students and sum of all marks.

3. **Calculate Average Marks**

   * Average marks were calculated by dividing total marks by total number of students.

4. **Find Maximum and Minimum Marks**

   * Identified the highest and lowest marks using Python's `max()` and `min()` functions.

5. **Find Top Students and Bottom Students**

   * Identified students with the highest and lowest marks using list comprehensions.

## Output

```
Total Students: 20
Average Marks: 85.55
Highest Marks: 95
Top Student(s): ['Khadija']
Lowest Marks: 77
Bottom Student(s): ['Hassan']
```
